# Alarm Clock Project

This is a Python project for creating a simple alarm clock application using the Tkinter graphical user interface library. This alarm clock allows you to set alarms with custom messages and labels, and it provides a digital clock display along with a list of upcoming and past alarms. The project uses various Python libraries, such as PIL, pygame, and datetime, to create a functional alarm clock application.

## Project Overview

This alarm clock project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter` for the graphical user interface.
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image processing.
- `pygame` for audio playback.
- `datetime` for managing time and dates.
- `time` for controlling time-related operations.
- `threading` for running background tasks concurrently.
- `json` for reading and writing data to a JSON file.

The application allows users to set alarms with custom messages and labels. When an alarm is triggered, a sound is played, and the alarm message is displayed. The application also features a digital clock display and lists upcoming and past alarms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this alarm clock project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow pygame
   ```

3. Download the project files and ensure you have the `alarm_icon.png` and `alarm_sound.wav` files in the same directory as the Python script.

4. Run the `alarm_clock.py` script.

5. The graphical user interface of the alarm clock application will appear. You can set alarms, customize their labels, and see the clock display.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script, `alarm_clock.py`. The script is organized as follows:

- **Import Statements:** Import the required Python libraries.

- **Data Storage:** Load and save alarm data to a JSON file, storing upcoming and past alarms, as well as alarm labels.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Create the main application window and set up the user interface components, including labels, input fields, buttons, and listboxes.

- **Alarm Functionality:** Implement the core alarm functionality, including setting and activating alarms, playing alarm sounds, and managing upcoming and past alarms.

- **Clock Display:** Create a digital clock display that updates in real-time.

- **Upcoming and Past Alarms:** Display lists of upcoming and past alarms in the GUI.

- **Countdown Timer (Uncompleted Feature):** There is a commented-out section for a countdown timer feature that can be implemented in the future.

## Features

1. **Set Alarms:** You can set alarms for specific times, with options to customize the alarm message and label.

2. **Activate and Deactivate Alarms:** Activate and deactivate alarms with corresponding buttons.

3. **Alarm Sound:** When an alarm is triggered, an alarm sound (`alarm_sound.wav`) is played.

4. **Clock Display:** A digital clock display is provided in the GUI.

5. **Upcoming and Past Alarms:** Lists of upcoming and past alarms with labels are displayed in the GUI.

6. **Customization:** You can customize alarm messages and labels.

7. **Data Persistence:** Alarm data is saved to a JSON file, so your alarms persist between application sessions.

## Usage

1. **Setting Alarms:**

   - Choose the alarm time using the hour, minute, and second dropdowns.
   - Optionally, enter a custom message and label for the alarm.
   - Click the "Activate" button to set the alarm.

2. **Deactivating Alarms:**

   - If an alarm is active, click the "Deactivate" button to stop the alarm.

3. **Clock Display:**

   - The digital clock display in the top right corner shows the current time.

4. **Upcoming and Past Alarms:**
   - Lists of upcoming and past alarms with labels are displayed below the clock.

## Customization

You can customize the project in several ways:

- Change the alarm sound by replacing `alarm_sound.wav` with another audio file.
- Modify the appearance of the GUI, such as colors, fonts, and layout.
- Implement additional features or extensions, such as an analog clock display or a countdown timer.

## Future Improvements

This project can be further enhanced with the following features and improvements:

1. **Repeat Alarms:** Add the ability to set alarms to repeat daily or on specific days.

2. **Snooze Functionality:** Implement a snooze button to delay the alarm for a few minutes.

3. **Analog Clock Display:** Create an analog clock display to complement the digital clock.

4. **Countdown Timer:** Implement the countdown timer feature that's currently commented out in the code.

5. **Alarm Sound Selection:** Allow users to select different alarm sounds.

6. **Settings and Preferences:** Add a settings menu to customize the application's behavior.

7. **Multithreading Enhancement:** Improve the multithreading to handle alarms more efficiently.

Remember to customize and extend this project according to your specific requirements and preferences. Enjoy your alarm clock application!
